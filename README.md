# CSIRO - IMAGE2BIOMASS PREDICTION
Building a model that predicts biomass using the provided pasture images

## Team

    Robert Koor - R4brt
    Anneli Oro - anneli-oro

## Goals
- Build model(s) that predict pasture biomass from images and ground-truth measurements
- Get $R^2$ score of 0.5 or higher

## Motivation: 
Help farmers to
- better estimate the amount of feed available
- track pasture health more accurately


Our model achieved $R^2$ score of 0.35 in the Kaggle environment

## How to reproduce our score

Although it is technically possible to run this notebook locally by adjusting the file paths and configuration variables, **we recommend running it in the Kaggle environment**.
The notebook is set up to use a GPU, and even with GPU acceleration the full training process takes about 30 minutes.
